## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK
- Maven
- ChromeDriver (managed by WebDriverManager)
- An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

### Running the Tests

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following Maven command to execute the tests:

```bash
$ mvn test
```

## How install Maven dependencies: 
```bash
$ mvn install -U
```

## More cucumber options: 
- src/test/java/com/nopCommerce/runners/TestRunner.java
```text
monochrome = true, "Removes ANSI control characters to improve readability."
tags = "@smoke", "Executes only the scenarios tagged as @smoke."
strict = true, "Causes the tests to fail if there are undefined or unimplemented steps."
dryRun = false, "Runs the scenarios without actually executing the steps (false: normal execution)."
snippets = SnippetType.CAMELCASE "Generates snippets using camelCase."
```

# *TestNG*
## How to run the project:


```shell
* Command line: 

$ mvn test -DsuiteXmlFile=testng.xml

Or 

Also is possible to run the specific file just right click on the file: `testng.xml` 
then choose the TestNG option to run the file
```
## To run the specific Scenario with @tag 

1. Add a @tag to specific scenario.
```Gherkin
  @Smoke
  Scenario: Check checkbox functionality
    Given the user is on the nonCommerce page
    When the user clicks on register
    Then the user checks the checkbox functionality working properly
```
2. Add this @tag on the cucumber options
```Properties
@CucumberOptions(
        features = "src/test/resources/features",
        glue = {"com.nopCommerce.steps", "com.nopCommerce.utils"},
        tags = "@Smoke",
        plugin = {
                "pretty",
                "html:target/cucumber-reports/report.html",
                "json:target/cucumber-reports/cucumber.json"
        }
)
```
3. Run with command line: 
```shell
$ mvn test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@Smoke" -DsuiteXmlFile=testng.xml
```
